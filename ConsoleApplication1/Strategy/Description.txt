Description:
	this pattern is make those algorithms interchangeable.

	for example: imagine got 3 car using the same method with same algorithm
					-Toyota
					-void
					-R8
				suddently got one new car wish to use the same method but different algorithm
					-yes, u can create a new method for new car 1, but how about got another new car 2, 3, 4, and 5 ??
					-r u gonna to create new method for new car 2, 3, 4, and 5 also ?? 
						This action only will make ur system suck, ur next developer also will suffer...

	* Strategy design pattern is a solution for this kind of problem

Description:
	Define an algorithm skeleton and delegate algorithm steps to subclasses so that they may be overridden

	- it actually create a Template for the first time, and make it able to fill in the blank with method of different class
	- it like a blueprint of the class
	- use the blueprint to built something with that blueprint / use the template to fill in the blank
	- best situation to use this design pattern is u have multiple operation, but these operation is similar
	- and the sequence of those operation is same

	for example: a poster Template, inside the template, it able to fill in different title, content, stamp, and even picture
